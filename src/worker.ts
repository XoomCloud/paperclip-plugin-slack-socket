// --- Config apply pump ---------------------------------------------------
//
// Bug: Node's AsyncLocalStorage context propagates into anything created
// inside `als.run(...)` — including sockets — and every later callback from
// that socket keeps running in the captured store. The plugin SDK wraps
// host->worker calls that carry a `paperclipInvocation` (e.g. `configChanged`)
// in `invocationContextStorage.run(...)` and echoes the store's invocation id
// on every worker->host call the plugin makes afterwards. If the Slack Bolt
// gateway were constructed synchronously inside `onConfigChanged`, it would
// be built inside that invocation's ALS store, and every subsequent Slack
// event (chat message, mention, action, command) would echo the id of a
// `configChanged` invocation the host finished long ago — the host looks it
// up, finds nothing, and denies the call with "unknown invocation scope".
//
// The fix: never call `applyConfig` (and therefore never construct the
// gateway) from inside `onConfigChanged` itself. Instead, `onConfigChanged`
// only enqueues the merged config and returns a promise that resolves once
// that job has been applied. A single pump loop, started once from `setup()`
// (i.e. with a clean/no ALS store), drains the queue. Because the pump's
// `for(;;)` loop and its `await waitForWork()` continuation were both set up
// outside any `als.run(...)` call, they resume in a clean store even though
// `signalPump()` is invoked synchronously from inside the `configChanged`
// invocation's store — a `new Promise(resolve => { wakePump = resolve })`
// does not adopt the calling context of whoever eventually calls `resolve()`,
// it keeps the context active at its own creation site. Any gateway created
// from within the pump's loop body therefore has no ALS store at all, exactly
// like `setup()` itself.

// --- Socket Mode watchdog -------------------------------------------------
//
// Bolt's socket-mode client stops reconnecting on unrecoverable failures
// (invalid/revoked/rotated token, exhausted network retries), and a
// `gateway.start()` that threw leaves `currentGateway` holding a DEAD,
// NON-NULL gateway — it is assigned just before the try/catch in
// `applyConfig`. Nothing else in this process ever retries, so without this
// poll the plugin sits degraded until an operator re-saves config by hand.
// The liveness check therefore probes rather than testing for a missing
// gateway, and it does not rest on `isConnected()` alone — that flag is fed
// by listeners attached to Bolt's private receiver internals with optional
// chaining, so it would silently never flip if Bolt's shape changed.
//
// RECOVERY GOES THROUGH THE PUMP AND NEVER CALLS `applyConfig` DIRECTLY.
// See the "Config apply pump" comment above for the full reasoning: a timer
// callback that constructed the gateway itself would build it inside
// whatever AsyncLocalStorage store happened to be active, after which every
// Slack event would echo the id of an invocation the host finished long ago
// and be denied with "unknown invocation scope". Enqueueing keeps gateway
// construction inside the pump's clean store. Re-applying also re-resolves
// both secret refs, so a rotated token is picked up without an operator save.
//
// Two more failure modes this section guards against, both found by review
// and reproduced empirically:
//  - A `probe()` that never settles must not wedge `recoveryInFlight` shut
//    forever. `gateway.probe()` is a plain HTTP call, and a WebClient with no
//    configured timeout plus Slack's default ~10-retries-over-~30-minutes
//    policy can leave it pending far longer than this watchdog's 60s tick
//    interval — precisely in the revoked-token case this feature exists to
//    fix, since that's when `isConnected()` is still true and the `&&` below
//    actually calls `probe()`. `probeWithTimeout` bounds every probe, for
//    every `SlackGateway` implementation, not just Bolt's.
//  - `liveConfig` must be re-read immediately before enqueueing a recovery
//    job, not reused from a value captured before the probe was awaited: an
//    operator's own config save can land and fully complete while a tick is
//    mid-probe (it isn't blocked by `recoveryInFlight`, which only guards
//    this function's own re-entrancy), and enqueueing a stale capture would
//    silently revert that completed save — including a narrowed
//    `allowedSlackUserIds`/`agentPostChannelIds`/`agentPostMessageEnabled`.

/**
 * Apply a fully-merged config: validate the required fields, resolve the
 * Slack secrets scoped to `cfg.companyId` (required outside an invocation —
 * this is the fix for the bug where `secrets.resolve` failed with "company
 * context is required"), and only then — once validation has fully
 * succeeded — tear down any existing gateway, commit `cfg` as the live
 * config, stand up a new gateway via the injected `makeGateway` factory, and
 * wire the socket handlers to the modules built by `ensureCoreModules` /
 * `ensureCompanyModules`.
 *
 * Validating before tearing down matters because this worker process is
 * shared by every company that has this plugin installed: a bad config
 * (typo'd secret ref, revoked token, etc.) must never take down a
 * previously-working connection. On failure the previous `liveConfig` and
 * `currentGateway` are left completely untouched. One consequence worth
 * naming: this also means a *revoked* posting permission (e.g. narrowing
 * `agentPostChannelIds` or turning `agentPostMessageEnabled` off) does not
 * take effect if the save fails — for example during a brief secrets-backend
 * outage — the previous, more permissive `liveConfig` stays live until a
 * save succeeds.
 *
 * This also enforces single-tenant binding: the host runs one worker
 * process per installed plugin, shared by every company that configures it,
 * and drops the RPC-level companyId, so the operator-typed `companyId`
 * field inside the config is the only company identifier available. The
 * first config to successfully apply binds this process to that company for
 * its lifetime; a config for any other company is refused outright so it
 * can never tear down company A's socket or leak company A's notifications
 * into company B's workspace.
 *
 * The binding itself is claimed synchronously (before any `await`), not
 * after the async validation/setup work completes — see the "claim-then-
 * verify" comment inline below for why: without it, two overlapping calls
 * for different companies can both observe an unclaimed process and race.
 *
 * This is the seam worker tests use to drive the full lifecycle with a
 * `FakeGateway`, without a real Bolt App. `onConfigChanged` (the real,
 * host-facing hook) and `startRuntime` (kept for tests) are both thin
 * wrappers around this.
